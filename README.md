# graphile-postgis

PostGIS support for PostGraphile v5.

## Overview

The original [`@graphile/postgis`](https://github.com/graphile/postgis) plugin does not support PostGraphile v5. This project aims to provide PostGIS support for PostGraphile v5.

**Note:** This project is **not compatible** with PostGraphile v4. If you're using PostGraphile v4, please use the original [`@graphile/postgis`](https://github.com/graphile/postgis) plugin instead.

## Status

This project is currently under development to bring PostGIS support to PostGraphile v5.
